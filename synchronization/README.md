### Future & Promise
1. In asynchronous programming, a ```std::future``` is an asynchronous return object ("an object that reads results from a shared state") and a ```std::promise``` is an asynchronous provider ("an object that provides a result to a shared state") i.e. a promise is the thing that you set a result on, so that you can get it from the associated future.
